    <p>Hi, I am Afrijal</p>

    <p>I was 13 years old when I started getting into web development and learned HTML and CSS. I build my first static site using my 2" Nokia 2330 and deploy it on <a href="https://xtgem.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XtGem.com</a>, we called it wapsite at that time. Then, I learned how to make my wapsite more attractive by adding some Javascript. Although now I think it was ugly.</p>

    <p>I now work at a startup in Yogyakarta as Backend Developer, but sometimes I handle frontend side as well. I often write program in Javascript and having fun with it.</p>

    <p>Besides web development, I also enjoy watching movies, travelling and do mountain hiking.
